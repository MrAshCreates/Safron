# Safron
Safron, the only app you need to manage all other applications on your system. You can use Safron to Build, Install, Update, and Delete various applications, Programs, or even little scripts using things like HomeBrew on MacOS or for Windows you can use Choco/Winget, and of course you can use the default package manger on the top linux systems. You can also use our world class in house technology to take GitHub projects to a new level. We can help you implement your project into our growing library of projects where you can easily build and install your favorite and upcoming projects such as the LadyBird Browser. All of this and more will slowly be rolled out and availble to beta testers.
